        There are many variations of passages
         of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
         have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
          humour, or randomised words which don't look even 
          slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage
           of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
            hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators 
            on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,</p></section>
    <section> <p>making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
         of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate
          Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from
           repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>></section>
